# Stock-Market-Predictions

Overview
---------------------
This is a repository that presents the stock market predictions for a particular company (Apple/'AAPL').The data trends are analysed for past 50 days to make the prediction on 51st date.Python keras package on Tensor flow back-end is used to train LSTM neural networks for the predictions.

Installation 
----------------------

##### Modules used:

1.  Pandas`
2.  Numpy
3.  matplotlib
4.  Keras

These moduls should be installed using ` pip install <module_name>`

Usage
----------------------
In order to use this project you should run :
`python New_York_Stock_Exchange_Predictions.py`

Data
----------------------
Data from kaggle:
New York Stock Exchange.
S&P 500 companies historical prices with fundemental data
https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse/data


Feature work
----------------------

This analysis provides great foundation for predicting stock prices per stock type.This will be extended to :
 
1.  Investigating any sign of correation of a perticular stock price with others.
2.  What's the optimum sequential_length (in this case 50) for the best prediction
3.  Using stock data starting from earlier decades.
4.  Understanding any significant difference of the behaviour between recent (after 2008)  and past stock prices.
